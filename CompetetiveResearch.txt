Customer Segment: Business Commuters Age 18-45 who are upper middle class and have time that is valuable, but flexible. 


Our current value prop is an app and sensor combination that tracks the amount of people on various trains and recommends the routes depending on user preferences such as personal space or efficient travel, Current apps on the market such as Roadify, Embark NYC, or Exit Strategy do not track the real time location of  trains or the amount or kinds of people on trains,so their use  is limited. However, exit strategy does tell you which part of the train to get on if one wants to exit as close as possible to one’s desired exit or destination,  which is a very useful feature and could be implemented in our product. The other two apps that were mentioned also display delays and other crowdsourced information about one's route. However, all of these apps  seem to be incomplete versions of an app that could address a lot more pains that our customer segment has.
We still need to go out and do more interviews or contact the makers of apps for the NYC subway system to try and gain a deep and insightful understanding of what jobs our customers have to do, what their pains are, and what gains they would like to see in their lives. As of now we are still not sure exactly what technology we could use for our product, but technologies such as CO2  sensors, cameras, or infrared sensors combined with low energy bluetooth or wifi could be used to make our value proposition a  reality.
