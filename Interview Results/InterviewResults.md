###Longer Interviews
<html>
<body><p>
Mary contacted different relatives and friends who fit the customer segment and asked them the following questions:<br><br>
What annoys you the most about commuting on the subway?<br><br>
What subway apps do you have downloaded on your phone? <br><br>
Would you be interested in an app that helps you avoid crowds and save time on a subway?<br><br>
Conclusively, they were most bothered by the people on the trains. After a long day of work, it’s bothersome to be surrounded by large crowds. When asked if they would stay at work longer to avoid the crowds, they responded that they would. Some of them often do just that. Based on their past experience, they will leave the office at the time of day that they believe will help them avoid rush hour. However, they noted it is not a very accurate system. Depending on holidays, weather, etc. commuting patterns change; it is often unpredictable.<br><br>
All of them had HopStop downloaded onto their phones. However, they infrequently use the app. The will only use it if they are traveling to a place they have never been, which is rare.<br><br>
They responded that they would definitely download an app that does those things if it is easy-to-use and accurate. User-interface was very important. Some of them also suggested adding the trip-planning aspect of the commute, which HopStop offers, would improve the product.

<h3>Transcript 1</h3>
<p>A discussion with a bus commuter<br><br>
Age 25, white female, lives in New Jersey, Commutes to Wall St.<br><br>

Q: Describe your commute.<br><br>
A: I leave my house at about 6:30 and take a 7 AM bus from my local mall to Port Authority. From there I walk underground and take the 2 train to wall street, then walk to my office which is a couple of blocks a day. I do the reverse on the way back. The time I leave depends on my workload. On a light day, I try to leave before 4:30 if I can because it’s less crowded. <br><br>

Q: During your travel time, what do you do?<br><br>
A: I generally read, answer emails, stuff like that. I try to sleep if I can but I don’t want to sleep through my stop so I mostly avoid sleeping. <br><br>

Q: Is there anything that you would change?<br><br>
A: I want to drive my car in with no traffic and park for free. That’d really be great.</p>

<h3>Transcript 2</h3>
<p>Interviews with non-subway commuters within the customer segmenet (that is, busniness people between the ages of 18-45) <br><br>

Subway Ride Interviews (Mary)<br><br>
Roughly 10 minute interviews with 6 different people (4 female, 2 male, varied ethnicities, throughout the age group of our customer segment)<br><br>
Goal: validate our value proposition<br><br>
Questions: <br><br>
Are you an 18-45 year old business person?<br><br>
Do you attend networking events/conferences career fairs?<br><br>
What bothers you most in that environment?<br><br>
Would you use a smart business card (that looks and feels like a credit card) that just taps and transfers information immediately onto your cellphone? <br><br>

Results: <br><br> 6/6 people expressed interest in the product. They were most interested in the speed, ease, and the organizational aspect of the card. They wanted to access the files on their computer in an organized way so that they could favorite the people from these events that they wanted to follow up with and actually make use of the information they discussed. <br><br>

##Individual Rounds -- Brian Phang

<html><body>
<p>Overview<br><br>
Throughout the week of October 19th, I conducted seven interviews in the area near TriBeCa. The interviews were conducted around 3:00 - 5:00PM. All interviewed persons were between the ages of 18 and 45 and work in a business related field.<br><br>
Person 1: He has a bachelor lifestyle. Work issues include organization and general file sorting. Larger issues involved home life. He does not enjoy cooking and prefers to have an easy order solution wherein he does not have to access any service site or app.<br><br>
Person 2: She has a family, one husband and two children. Work related issues stem from inability to sort files intuitively. Connecting to other people in different sectors of work is also an issue if they aren't already in constant contact. Her home life revolves around food and not spending enough time with her children. She would prefer it if her work could be facilitated in some way so she can leave work earlier.<br><br>
Person 3: She has a boyfriend. Her love life is not going as well as she would like. She delved into specifics of her love life that should not be reproduced in text. Her work life revolves around sitting in front of the computer and using Microsoft Word to format much of what her employers wrote.<br><br>
Person 4: He is in a managerial position. His pains invluded not being in contact with his employees and not having a better software to better dictate his orders to his employees. He is married and has no children. He has issues paying the bills on time. Much of their money is spent on clothes and food.<br><br>
Person 5: She is single and lives with her parents. Student loans are a large issue for her. She had a lot of trouble finding a job and very recently acquired one. Organizing her resumes and CV's and business card holder was a large issue in job-finding. Although she handed out a lot of paper resumes, much of her more successful job searches involved sending an email of her resume and cover letter to the company, albeit they took a bit longer to respond to her. Home life is fairly stable and no large problems whatsoever.<br><br>
Person 6: He was a financial advisor and recently switched occupations to being a stock broker. He found that he did not have to have a large resume because much of the business involved inter-person connections. Overall, his life is stable. He is a bachelor and lives in a penthouse near West Side Highway.<br><br>
Person 7: He is a bachelor with body image issues. He works out every day for at least 4 hours but has yet to look any thinner. His work issues include more employee interaction and he doesn't have a good grasp on how to talk to his coworkers. Further interviewing led to much complaing about body standards of today's era. <br><br>
