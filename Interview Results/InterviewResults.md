###Longer Interviews
<html>
<body><p>
Mary contacted different relatives and friends who fit the customer segment and asked them the following questions:<br><br>
What annoys you the most about commuting on the subway?<br><br>
What subway apps do you have downloaded on your phone? <br><br>
Would you be interested in an app that helps you avoid crowds and save time on a subway?<br><br>
Conclusively, they were most bothered by the people on the trains. After a long day of work, it’s bothersome to be surrounded by large crowds. When asked if they would stay at work longer to avoid the crowds, they responded that they would. Some of them often do just that. Based on their past experience, they will leave the office at the time of day that they believe will help them avoid rush hour. However, they noted it is not a very accurate system. Depending on holidays, weather, etc. commuting patterns change; it is often unpredictable.<br><br>
All of them had HopStop downloaded onto their phones. However, they infrequently use the app. The will only use it if they are traveling to a place they have never been, which is rare.<br><br>
They responded that they would definitely download an app that does those things if it is easy-to-use and accurate. User-interface was very important. Some of them also suggested adding the trip-planning aspect of the commute, which HopStop offers, would improve the product.

<p>Transcript<br><br>
A discussion with a bus commuter<br><br>
Age 25, white female, lives in New Jersey, Commutes to Wall St.<br><br>

Q: Describe your commute.<br><br>
A: I leave my house at about 6:30 and take a 7 AM bus from my local mall to Port Authority. From there I walk underground and take the 2 train to wall street, then walk to my office which is a couple of blocks a day. I do the reverse on the way back. The time I leave depends on my workload. On a light day, I try to leave before 4:30 if I can because it’s less crowded. <br><br>

Q: During your travel time, what do you do?<br><br>
A: I generally read, answer emails, stuff like that. I try to sleep if I can but I don’t want to sleep through my stop so I mostly avoid sleeping. <br><br>

Q: Is there anything that you would change?<br><br>
A: I want to drive my car in with no traffic and park for free. That’d really be great.</p>
