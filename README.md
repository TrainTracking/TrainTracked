    <p> We are developing a product for 18 to 45 year-old business-oriented subway commuters whose time is flexible but valuable. When the sole responsibility of a commuter is to travel to work quickly and easily, crowds and unpredictable wait-times can be frustrating. Whether time is spent waiting underground for the train to arrive or standing amongst a crowd in the traincar without room to read or do work, that time is wasted. We want commuters to know when a train is coming and exactly how many people are on it, so that they can travel the way they want to. </p>
    <p> TrainTracked is a phone application that notifies its users of the arrival times of NYC subway trains and the number of people on said trains. It gathers its information through a smart device located within every subway car that counts the number of cellular devices in the car using wifi-sniffers and low energy bluetooth. It is important to note that we are still researching whether this product is a viable solution to the problems that surfaced during customer interviews. We are going to continue our interviews to discover other problems that our customer segment may face. Because the current problem is obvious, its solution may be difficult to conclude. Therefore, if further research shows that solving a different problem is more viable, we will pivot toward a new product that we can develop within the semester.</p>
    <p> We are currently in the proces of consumer research. Through various interviews, we are discovering the the needs of subway commuters and their desire for our product. To learn more about our research, check out the research folder!</p>
