###Competetive Landscape Research

<html>
<body>
<p>Customer Segment: Business Commuters Age 18-45 who are upper middle class and have time that is valuable, but flexible.<br><br>
Our current value prop is an app and sensor combination that tracks the amount of people on various trains and recommends the routes depending on user preferences such as personal space or efficient travel, Current apps on the market such as Roadify, Embark NYC, or Exit Strategy do not track the real time location of  trains or the amount or kinds of people on trains,so their use  is limited. However, exit strategy does tell you which part of the train to get on if one wants to exit as close as possible to one’s desired exit or destination,  which is a very useful feature and could be implemented in our product. The other two apps that were mentioned also display delays and other crowdsourced information about one's route. However, all of these apps  seem to be incomplete versions of an app that could address a lot more pains that our customer segment has.<br><br>
We still need to go out and do more interviews or contact the makers of apps for the NYC subway system to try and gain a deep and insightful understanding of what jobs our customers have to do, what their pains are, and what gains they would like to see in their lives. As of now we are still not sure exactly what technology we could use for our product, but technologies such as CO2  sensors, cameras, or infrared sensors combined with low energy bluetooth or wifi could be used to make our value proposition a  reality.

###Summary
<html>
<body><p>
A method for tracking people and subway trains in order to control crowds and provide train arrival times remotely. This can be achieved through a sensor that can track the number of electronic devices in a given space based on wifi or bluetooth, RFID or ultra wideband tracking, or a sensor on the train-tracks coupled with cameras that count heads on the train. The data collected from the sensor could interpret when a train is arriving (i.e. if a large number of electronic devices/heads are traveling together at a certain speed in a certain direction, the assumption can be made that they are on a specific train that will arrive at “x” time), and how crowded a train is (maybe even how crowded a train car is). A person who rides the subway regularly can know when exactly their train is arriving - even from outside of the station - and make a decision based on the crowds whether or not they want to take the train at that time.

###Technology
<html>
<body><p>
RapidBlue Solutions and ShopperTrak partnered to develop interior analytic solutions that track shoppers behaviors once they enter a store. Similar technology can be applied within a subway station. This technology includes bluetooth, wifi, and GSM. If the connection is available, bluetooth and wifi would be most effective to track subway train timing as they provide the highest ping frequency. https://vimeo.com/70339461?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonu6%2FMZKXonjHpfsX56ewqXaC%2FlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATMZrI%2BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFT7PDMbR00LgMWhM%3D <br><br>
Using a wifi sniffer, you could track the number of mobile devices in the area. If wifi is installed on your iphone, the sniffer recognizes the phone’s unique mac address.

Using a BLE (bluetooth low energy) proximity sensor, we can detect when a mobile device is close to a sensor.

Alternatively, a wireless sensor network can track the location of the trains, while video cameras within the train do a headcount using video analytics like envysion products do. http://research.unl.edu/annualreport/2013/developing-sensors-to-enhance-rail-safety/

One of the most accurate interior analytic solutions is ultra wideband, but ultra wideband requires power. Another option for this project is to transform ultra wideband into a passive technology that can be integrated into a metrocard.

###My Pitch
<html>
<body><p>
Let’s create a simple, cost-effective, and connected combination of selected technologies from above. For our project we will investigate what new combinations of technology would most simply and accurately notify commuters of travel times and crowds. Based on the knowledge and resources of our group, we will choose from the solutions above, and further investigate by talking to commuters and employees of the NYC subway system to learn what the market will support and what the consumer needs from our potential solution.

###Customer Segment
<html>
<body><p>
18-45 year old business-oriented New York City subway commuters who have flexible, but valuable time

###Value Proposition
<html>
<body><p>
A train tracking app that solves the problems of time waste during a commute by telling the user exactly when a train will arrive at the station, and crowded trains by notifying the user of the number of people on the train at a time. 
</p></body></html>

###Customer Research
<html>
<body><p>
I called different relatives and friends who fit the customer segment and asked them the following questions:<br><br>
What annoys you the most about commuting on the subway?<br><br>
What subway apps do you have downloaded on your phone? <br><br>
Would you be interested in an app that helps you avoid crowds and save time on a subway?<br><br>
Conclusively, they were most bothered by the people on the trains. After a long day of work, it’s bothersome to be surrounded by large crowds. When asked if they would stay at work longer to avoid the crowds, they responded that they would. Some of them often do just that. Based on their past experience, they will leave the office at the time of day that they believe will help them avoid rush hour. However, they noted it is not a very accurate system. Depending on holidays, weather, etc. commuting patterns change; it is often unpredictable.<br><br>
All of them had HopStop downloaded onto their phones. However, they infrequently use the app. The will only use it if they are traveling to a place they have never been, which is rare.<br><br>
They responded that they would definitely download an app that does those things if it is easy-to-use and accurate. User-interface was very important. Some of them also suggested adding the trip-planning aspect of the commute, which HopStop offers, would improve the product. 
</p></body></html>

###Competitors
<html>
<body><p>
Current New York City subway app competitors include HopStop, Embark NYC, and MTA SubwayTime. Neither HopStop nor Embark NYC offer train tracking or crowd control. However, MTA SubwayTime offers train tracking features. The app only tracks the trains on 8 of the 24 NYC Subway lines. Ultimately, none of the apps do what our train tracking app would offer. Although members of our customer segment have these apps downloaded to their phones, they use them infrequently. Our customer segment wants to be informed about crowds and train timing daily, and would get more use out of an app that does just that. Incorporating the mapping attributes of Embark NYC and HopStop would expand our market and supplant the need for either of those apps as a whole.<br><br> 
Apple recently purchased HopStop and the application is shutting down October 2015.</p></body></html>

###Possible Customer Segment Research
<html>
<body><p>
Based on the interviews that I personally conducted in two days at the 42nd Street Station and 14th Street—Union Square Station, people do not care about having a seat on the train. Most people are either going to work or rushing home and simply do not need a seat on the train. However, most elderly and injured people I talked to had a few concerns about seating but were ultimately solved because there is almost always a person to offer his seat. One main issue many people brought up is the homeless situation on the trains. As the weather gets colder, many of the homeless population move onto trains where the pungent odor of unsanitary people remains. Another issue that a large number or interviewees brought up is that during rush hour, they receive many involuntary touches that may be unwarranted. If we figure out the maximum number of passengers that a train can carry and limit each train car to a certain number of passengers during rush hour, we can probably stop the unwarranted contact between riders. Another problem is that trains such as the R and the A arrive in 10 minute intervals which can cause extreme lateness for certain riders. Furthermore, signal delays have been more frequent along the R and Q lines. Our train tracker can probably fix these issues and help to increase the frequency of trains in between stations. <br><br>
Since I only interviewed 27 people, I feel that the data I gathered is not enough to represent the entire MTA population. If we were to conduct a survey or obtain a survey FAQ list from the MTA website, it would be possible to better our understanding of the situation preventing the subway to be one of the less stressful methods of travel in the city. Since not many people care about finding a seat on the subway, the project would be more successful if our people-tracker could limit the amount of people in each car to lower the time it takes for trains to remain in the station and speed up the trains so that intervals between stations would only be 3 or 4 minutes. <br><br>
Wi-Fi is now available to certain train stations and can be used in our project. Since most major stations such as the 42nd Street—Times Square, 14th Street—Union Square, and Jay St. Metrotech stations have Wi-Fi signals that our people-counter system can take advantage of. There does not appear to be large amounts of traffic at local stops so there is no reason to have the people counter work on those.<br><br>

###Customer Segment
<html>
<body><p>
After careful consideration, our product targets people of the upper-middle class with smartphones that commute and that want to use their time wisely. This applies to people that live both inside and outside of the city. <br><br>

###Value Proposition 
<html>
<body><p>
The ideal way to deliver information to our customer segment would be through their phone, so the end goal is create an app that will display the real-time location and occupancy for the subway cars. In order to make this a reality, we would need to place sensors on the subway cars that are able to determine the number of people on the cars and how far along the cars are on their routes. <br><br>
###Technology
<html>
<body><p>
Today, the common practice for tracking vehicles is through GPS, whether it is with smartphones or devices that have a built in sensor. Effective examples of this tracking is MTA Bus Time Technology, which allows the MTA to track all of its buses throughout New York City and accurately determine when they will make it to their stops. Amtrak also offers users the ability track trains, where the sensors are placed on the tracks and as the train passes by it sends a signal relaying its location. Now this effective because these buses and trains stay above ground, allowing the sensors to remain in contact with GPS and determine their locations. Since the subway is underground a different kind of locator is needed, and the alternative is a device that relies on preloaded maps, timing, and accelerometers to determine its location. The second part of our idea requires the counting of people on the subway cars. People counting is not a new idea as seen with companies like SenSource, Inc. or Traf-Sys, Inc. that specialize in developing technology for this purpose. However, these systems are designed for retail environments, so that businesses can measure the foot traffic in their stores and they tend to be expensive. Simpler devices exist but they may not provide accurate data as they use infra-red sensors that can be easily triggered. For these reasons, a sensor that could measure electromagnetic radiation for a specific range of frequencies, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, is logical as it could determine the number of devices on the subway cars and therefore the number of people. <br><br>
###Research
<html>
<body><p>
Our initial set of interviews confirmed our beliefs that many subway commuters were annoyed by the crowds and delays associated with the subway and many just wanted more space on the train. While useful, these interviews were conducted very quickly and may not display some of the subtler annoyances that people associate with the subway. In order to further support our findings, we need to collect information from interviews that last longer than 30 seconds to better understand the pains of the people in our customer segment.
