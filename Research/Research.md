###Competetive Landscape Research

<p>Customer Segment: Business Commuters Age 18-45 who are upper middle class and have time that is valuable, but flexible.<br><br>
Our current value prop is an app and sensor combination that tracks the amount of people on various trains and recommends the routes depending on user preferences such as personal space or efficient travel, Current apps on the market such as Roadify, Embark NYC, or Exit Strategy do not track the real time location of  trains or the amount or kinds of people on trains,so their use  is limited. However, exit strategy does tell you which part of the train to get on if one wants to exit as close as possible to one’s desired exit or destination,  which is a very useful feature and could be implemented in our product. The other two apps that were mentioned also display delays and other crowdsourced information about one's route. However, all of these apps  seem to be incomplete versions of an app that could address a lot more pains that our customer segment has.<br><br>
We still need to go out and do more interviews or contact the makers of apps for the NYC subway system to try and gain a deep and insightful understanding of what jobs our customers have to do, what their pains are, and what gains they would like to see in their lives. As of now we are still not sure exactly what technology we could use for our product, but technologies such as CO2  sensors, cameras, or infrared sensors combined with low energy bluetooth or wifi could be used to make our value proposition a  reality.

###Possible Customer Segment Research

Based on the interviews that I personally conducted in two days at the 42nd Street Station and 14th Street—Union Square Station, people do not care about having a seat on the train. Most people are either going to work or rushing home and simply do not need a seat on the train. However, most elderly and injured people I talked to had a few concerns about seating but were ultimately solved because there is almost always a person to offer his seat. One main issue many people brought up is the homeless situation on the trains. As the weather gets colder, many of the homeless population move onto trains where the pungent odor of unsanitary people remains. Another issue that a large number or interviewees brought up is that during rush hour, they receive many involuntary touches that may be unwarranted. If we figure out the maximum number of passengers that a train can carry and limit each train car to a certain number of passengers during rush hour, we can probably stop the unwarranted contact between riders. Another problem is that trains such as the R and the A arrive in 10 minute intervals which can cause extreme lateness for certain riders. Furthermore, signal delays have been more frequent along the R and Q lines. Our train tracker can probably fix these issues and help to increase the frequency of trains in between stations. <br><br>
Since I only interviewed 27 people, I feel that the data I gathered is not enough to represent the entire MTA population. If we were to conduct a survey or obtain a survey FAQ list from the MTA website, it would be possible to better our understanding of the situation preventing the subway to be one of the less stressful methods of travel in the city. Since not many people care about finding a seat on the subway, the project would be more successful if our people-tracker could limit the amount of people in each car to lower the time it takes for trains to remain in the station and speed up the trains so that intervals between stations would only be 3 or 4 minutes. <br><br>
Wi-Fi is now available to certain train stations and can be used in our project. Since most major stations such as the 42nd Street—Times Square, 14th Street—Union Square, and Jay St. Metrotech stations have Wi-Fi signals that our people-counter system can take advantage of. There does not appear to be large amounts of traffic at local stops so there is no reason to have the people counter work on those.<br><br>
