<p>Slide 1: You may remember us as TrainTracked <br><br>

Slide 2: We made the assumption that the following problems exist. <br><br>

Slide 3: And we interviews 18-45 year old business oriented people to prove that was the case. <br><br>

Slide 3: However our solution to these problems would have to be sold to the MTA and NOT our customer segment, and we realized we did not really have a viable customer for a product. The MTA has no incentive to eliminate train crowds, people still ride the subway anyway.<br><br>

Slide 5: So we went out and interviewed our customer segment again. We just asked them to generally share their problems, and then we looked for a common thread.<br><br>

Slide 6: This graph represents our results. After talking to 7 people, we heard that a lot of people were having difficulty networking with paper resumes and organizing files on their computers.<br><br>

Slide 7: So we came up with The Smart Business Card. <br><br>

Slide 8: {play video for smart business card} <br><br>

Slide 9: First, we designed a value proposition. <br><br>

Slide 10: When you come back from a conference, networking event, or career fair having collected a stack of business cards and resumes - you lose track of the people and conversations who matter. You lose the opportunity to connect. We want to create a product that makes it easy for you to keep track of those conversations right when they happen.<br><br>

Slide 11: To further confirm that this pursuit was worthwhile, we did a second set of interviews.<br><br>

Slide 12: The problems people resonated most with were the uselessness of exchanging paper resumes and the need for easy organization of files. <br><br>

Slide 13: So we redesigned our value prop to stress organization.<br><br>

Slide 14: Then we took our product to the streets to see what people thought of the user experience.<br><br>

Slide 15: All of the people we interviewed like the idea, but expressed some security concerns and the potential to improve the user interface - which we are in the process of doing. <br><br>

Slide 16: To further validate our products potential we did 3 sets of longer, detailed interviews with various professionals who attend conferences regularly. <br><br>

Slide 17: (Results) <br><br>
Slide 18: We have a beta site to collect data. This website gives customers the opportunity to pre-order the product without it being available. This way we can test interest without losing money building a prototype. We have collected X emails.
