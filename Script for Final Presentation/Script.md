<p>Slide 1: Hi my name is () and you may remember us as TrainTracked.<br><br>

Slide 2:  We started the semester trying to solve the problems of 18-45 year old business oriented subway commuters.<br><br>

Slide 3:  We thought that they struggled with crowds and wait times so we wanted to make a product that would go in every subway car to track the location of the train and the number of people on the train. <br><br>

Slide 4: We interviewed 30 people, asking them 2 questions each - and the data we collected seemed to affirm that we were solving a real problem. However we realized that those interviews were superficial. We asked if the problems we presumed existed were real, but we didn’t ask what problems our customers wanted solved. <br><br>

Slide 5: We also realized that a product that goes in every train car would have to be sold to the MTA, and not our customer at all.<br><br>

Slide 6: We went back to the streets to try to have real conversations with members of our customer segment. We asked what their problems were. At first the conversations were open-ended, but once we noticed a repetition of problems in business communications - we led our interviewees down that path and found that people were frustrated with file organization and networking. This is the significant data we compiled.<br><br>

Slide 7: We pivoted to The Smart Business Card. <br><br>

Slide 8: {play video for smart business card} <br><br>

Slide 9: First, we designed a value proposition. <br><br>

Slide 10: When you come back from a conference, networking event, or career fair having collected a stack of business cards and resumes - you lose track of the people and conversations who matter. You lose the opportunity to connect. We want to create a product that makes it easy for you to keep track of those conversations right when they happen.<br><br>

Slide 11: To further confirm that this pursuit was worthwhile, we did a second set of interviews.<br><br>

Slide 12: The problems people resonated most with were the uselessness of exchanging paper to connect because they lose track of everything, and the need for easy organization of files.<br><br>

Slide 13: So we redesigned our value prop to stress organization. <br><br>

Slide 14: Then we took our product to the streets to see what people thought of the user experience.<br><br>

Slide 15: The user interface is a main aspect of our product so we were expecting to hear useful feedback in that category. But new security concerns rose - how do we make sure the information only transfers from card to phone and not phone to card? So that is something new we took into consideration. <br><br>

Slide 16: To further validate our products potential we did 3 sets of longer, detailed interviews with various professionals who attend conferences regularly. <br><br>

Slide 17: They advised us to optimize our technology so that files can also be organized by the location. So if you can’t remember when you met someone, but where you did - you can search that way. They also suggested using existing business networks as a platform to get the project started. <br><br>

Slide 18: We are collecting emails through our beta site to get feedback and test interest. We currently have x emails. <br><br>

Slide 19: We also have a kickstarter page that explains our technology and price projections.
