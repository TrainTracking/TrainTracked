<body>
<p>
6/6 people expressed interest in the product. They were most interested in the speed, ease, and the organizational aspect of the card. They wanted to access the files on their computer in an organized way so that they could favorite the people from these events that they wanted to follow up with and actually make use of the information they discussed.

##Questions:
<html>
<body>
<p>
I shared our value proposition, product summary, and beta website, then asked for their honest thoughts:<br><br>
1) Does this product solve the problems we raised?<br><br>
2) Would you purchase it?<br><br>
</p>
</body>

##Resutls:
<html>
<body>
<p>The interviewees felt our product was solving a problem but wanted to make sure we optimized the technology we were using. RFID has the potential to track locations, and through cloud technology the database can expand to connect with LinkedIn accounts. Use these opportunities to better solve the problem.
