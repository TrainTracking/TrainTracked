<p>The Smart Business Card is a metal business card that stores all of the business information that you want to store on it: this ranges from contact information to full resumes and website links. This way, when you go to a conference, career fair, or any networking event: meeting people is quick and easy, the Smart Business Card keeps track of all of the information for you. Upon purchasing the Smart Business Card, you get an identification code to an online Account. You use that ID to create a personal profile. Store all of the information you want on your business card onto the profile. Through your account, you will also have acess to a system that organizes all of the contacts you connect with. Every time someone taps their business card against your phone, a folder is created with the date. Within the folder, there is another folder with the person's name - click on that folder to access all of the info they want to share with you!
